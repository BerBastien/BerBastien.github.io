I am a PhD candidate in Geography at UC Davis working in integrated assessment models of climate change in [Fran Moore](https://franmoore.faculty.ucdavis.edu/lab-group/)'s research group. I am particularly interested in climate impacts on natural capital and its associated effects on ecosystems services and human well-being.


I am co-host and creator of [Planeteando](https://planeteando.org), a platform for climate change and environmental science communication.
