I am a PhD candidate in Geography at UC Davis, working in integrated assessment models of climate change in Fran Mooreâ€™s research group. I am particularly interested in climate impacts on natural capital and its associated effects on ecosystems services and human well-being.

I am co-host and creator of Planeteando, a platform for climate change and environmental science communication.
